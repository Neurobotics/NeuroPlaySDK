# NeuroPlaySDK

NeuroPlay devices are Bluetooth bioamplifiers.  
NeuroPlay/NeuroPlayPro apps are multiplatform (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS) apps with HTTP/WebSockets/COM-port API

NeuroPlayPro app connects to devices:
- NeuroPlay-6C, NeuroPlay-8Cap
- MCS NVX
- MCS EMG-SENS

**'Native'** projects show how to connect to NeuroPlay devices over Bluetooth BLE  
**'NeuroPlayPro'** projects show connection to NeuroPlay/NeuroPlayPro app over HTTP/WebSockets protocol or COM-port

Currently there are:
- Arduino/Native 
- Arduino/NeuroPlayPro [COM-port or HTTP]
- GameMaker/NeuroPlayPro
- Python/Native
- Python/NeuroPlayPro
