# NeuroPlaySDK

[NeuroPlay](https://neuroplay.ru) devices are Bluetooth bioamplifiers.  
[NeuroPlayPro](https://neuroplay.ru/downloads/neuroplaypro) app is a multiplatform (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS) app with HTTP/WebSockets/COM-port API

NeuroPlayPro app connects to devices:
- NeuroPlay-6C, NeuroPlay-8Cap
- MCS NVX
- MCS EMG-SENS

**'Native'** projects show NeuroPlay devices connection over Bluetooth BLE  
**'NeuroPlayPro'** projects show NeuroPlayPro app connection over HTTP/WebSockets protocol or COM-port

Currently there are:
- Arduino/Native 
- Arduino/NeuroPlayPro [COM-port or HTTP]
- GameMaker/NeuroPlayPro
- Python/Native
- Python/NeuroPlayPro
- [C++(QT)/Native](https://github.com/Neurobotics/NeuroPlayMinQt)
- [C++(QT)/NeuroPlayPro](https://github.com/Neurobotics/NeuroplayPro-QtSDK)
